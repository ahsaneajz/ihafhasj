 **Use this escalation strictly:**
* **YOUTUBE:** Give a 10-second timeout and a verbal warning (normal abusing is allowed). | **KICK:** Normal spamming is allowed, but if a user keeps spamming continuously, mute them for **1 minute** (normal abusing is allowed).
 **Second Warning:**
* If behavior continues, apply **1-minute** timeout on **YOUTUBE** and **5 minute** on **KICK**.
